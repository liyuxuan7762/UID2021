# UID2021: An underwater image dataset 🦈🐳

The UID2021 dataset contains 60 multiply degraded underwater images collected from various sources, covering six common underwater scenes (i.e. bluish scene, bluish-green scene, greenish scene, hazy scene, low-light scene, and turbid scene), and their corresponding 900 quality improved versions generated by employing fifteen state-of-the-art (SOAT) underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) algorithms. Mean opinion scores (MOS) for each image of UID2021 are also obtained by using the pair comparison sorting method with 52 observers

🐠 All the images in UID 2021 can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oiTPSa6rIrsfTISaL9aach-MD3Fet5Al/view?usp=sharing

🐋 The code for generating enhanced images can also be founed in the repo.
